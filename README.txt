OpenSDP Data Janitor Tutorial (Stata)
Nearly Unique

This tutorial teaches how to implement decision rules in Stata when
cleaning longitudinal data. You will start with a sample data file that is
nearly unique at the student and school year level, and clean each variable
until the data is internally consistent.

You will need to have Stata version 12 or higher installed on your computer to
run this tutorial. Download, unzip, and extract the files. Open the .smcl file,
and arrange the viewer and main Stata windows side by side so that you can
see them both. Work through the tutorial by clicking on commands in the viewer
window or typing them into the Stata command window.
